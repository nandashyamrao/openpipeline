## Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the practical aspects of **Open Pipeline**, a critical component in the observability architecture of **Dynatrace**. Open Pipeline serves as a robust framework for managing data streams, enabling users to efficiently ingest, process, and analyze data from various sources. This chapter builds upon previous discussions regarding Open Pipeline's functionality and architecture, providing a hands-on demonstration of its capabilities in a trading platform context. The significance of this topic lies in its potential to enhance performance monitoring by allowing users to segment and process data streams, ultimately leading to better insights and decision-making.

Key concepts discussed include:
- **Data Separation**: The process of dividing incoming data streams into distinct pipelines for focused processing.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Mechanisms for directing data to appropriate processing paths based on defined conditions.
- **Metric Extraction**: The ability to derive meaningful metrics from raw data.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Procedures for managing and obfuscating sensitive information.

## Setting the Stage: Demo Environment Overview

The hands-on session begins with an overview of the demo setup, which revolves around a mock trading application named **Easy Trade**. This application simulates a trading platform for stock market instruments, running on a **Docker Compose** setup. The environment also includes:
- **OneAgent**: A Dynatrace monitoring agent installed on the host, responsible for collecting data from various services and containers.
- **Grail**: The underlying data processing and storage technology that Open Pipeline interfaces with.

### Key Features of the Demo Environment:
- **Easy Trade Application**: Available on GitHub, providing detailed documentation and access to the demo.
- **Kubernetes Playground**: An alternative setup that showcases the same functionality in a Kubernetes environment.

## Implementing Data Separation

The core objective of the session is to demonstrate data separationâ€”essentially splitting incoming data into manageable streams for focused processing. The process begins with the creation of pipelines and routing conditions to filter relevant data. 

### Steps Involved:
1. **Creating Pipelines**: Adding a new pipeline specifically for the frontend reverse proxy of the Easy Trade application.
2. **Setting Up Routing**: Configuring the routing table to ensure that only relevant data (in this case, production data) is directed to the new pipeline.

### DQL Query Usage:
During the setup, a Data Query Language (**DQL**) query is used to handle log records. The focus is on separating production log lines from irrelevant pre-production data, thereby streamlining data processing.

## Processing Log Records

With the pipelines established, the next phase involves processing incoming log records. The presentation emphasizes the importance of transforming raw data into a structured format that is more informative and usable.

### Key Processing Actions:
- **Log Record Cleanup**: Transforming cryptic log entries into readable formats using built-in technology bundles.
- **Sensitive Data Management**: Hashing sensitive information, such as account IDs, to ensure compliance and security.
- **Metric Extraction**: Capturing relevant metrics like content length for performance analysis.
- **Business Event Extraction**: Identifying critical steps in user interactions, such as logins and trades.

### Example:
The session presents a specific log record from an **Nginx** server, illustrating the transformation from a raw log entry to a structured format that includes useful fields like status codes and HTTP methods.

## The Live Demo: Creating and Configuring Pipelines

The practical demonstration allows viewers to see the configuration process in real-time. The presenter walks through the creation of a new pipeline for the frontend reverse proxy, detailing each step involved.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Adding Processors**: Using the built-in Nginx parser to process incoming logs and extract critical information.
2. **Configuring DQL Statements**: Crafting DQL statements for parsing and cleaning up log entries, particularly focusing on the HTTP target field to sanitize sensitive data.
3. **Finalizing the Pipeline**: Completing the configuration by adding extraction metrics and event definitions.

### Metrics and Business Events:
The session highlights how to extract metrics related to content length and establish business events for key processes like user logins and trades, showcasing how these metrics can be visualized within the Dynatrace dashboard.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this chapter provides an in-depth look at the hands-on capabilities of Open Pipeline, emphasizing its role in enhancing observability within complex applications. By demonstrating how to separate data streams, process log records, and extract meaningful metrics, the session illustrates the practical applications of Open Pipeline in real-world scenarios.

### Key Takeaways:
- Open Pipeline is crucial for data management, allowing for focused processing of log data.
- The ability to separate data streams enhances scalability and management efficiency.
- Implementing robust processing techniques, including sensitive data handling and metric extraction, is vital for meaningful data analysis.
- The hands-on demonstration serves as a guide for users interested in leveraging Open Pipeline for their observability needs.

As the session concludes, the presenters encourage audience engagement through feedback and exploration of Open Pipeline's features, highlighting the ongoing developments and innovations expected in the future. The chapter serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and applying Open Pipeline in various contexts, paving the way for improved data observability and analytics.
